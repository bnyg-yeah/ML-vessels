DBSCAN code is currently limited to 30k sample size because my computer cannot handle an entire csv file. Currently only clusters based on location related features such as: impossible implied speed, sudden large speed jumps, sudden large speed drops, long time gaps + small movement, movement that doesn’t match normal patterns, abnormal accelerations, teleport-like distance jumps
